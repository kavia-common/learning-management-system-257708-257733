# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the variables as needed:

- `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY` are required for Supabase email/password auth.
- `REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL` should point to your frontend origin for email confirmation redirects.
- If you integrate with a backend, set `REACT_APP_API_BASE` or `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` as needed.

## Authorization notes

- The app uses Supabase and a `profiles` table with a `role` field (`employee` or `admin`).
- The route guard (`src/auth/ProtectedRoute.js`) will:
  - Redirect unauthenticated users to `/signin`.
  - For role-gated routes (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`), show a short "Checking permissions..." state while the user’s profile/role is loading, then allow or deny based on `profile.role`.
  - This avoids false “Unauthorized” screens if the role has not loaded yet.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
